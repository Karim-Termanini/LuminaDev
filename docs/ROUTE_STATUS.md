# Route Status Matrix (Tauri)

This file is the operator-facing truth table for UI behavior while hardening continues.
Use it during manual verification to avoid treating placeholder behavior as regressions.

Status legend:
- `live` = real backend behavior expected
- `partial` = core behavior works, but one or more flows are simplified/limited
- `stub` = placeholder/demo/static behavior, not production-complete
- `redirect` = legacy route, automatically redirected to a primary route
- `removed` = route intentionally removed; redirect may still exist for bookmarks

| Route | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/dashboard` | partial | Preset grid reads `active_profile` for highlight; slim container count + metrics strip with links to Docker and Monitor; several preset cards are `PLANNED`/disabled. |
| `/dashboard/kernels` | partial | GPU probe, service states, security audit; auto-refreshes every ~30s (lightweight snapshot, not a full device manager). |
| `/dashboard/logs` | partial | Jobs poll ~2s; compose logs load for selected profile; not a full observability platform. |
| `/dashboard/widgets` | removed | **Deleted** 2026-05-29 — widget system out of scope; no route or redirect. |
| `/system` | partial | Metrics and monitor data are live; per-container stats on Docker page; some sections still bounded snapshots. |
| `/docker` | live | Main Docker slice (list/actions/logs/images/volumes/networks/cleanup/remap) is functional with guardrails. |
| `/ssh` | partial | Core SSH key/test/setup flows work; advanced transfer/remote UX still evolving. |
| `/git` | live | Primary Git hub — tabbed layout (**Config** = identity/behavior/security/inspector + Git Doctor; **VCS** = status/stage/diff/commit/branches/fetch/pull/push/merge/rebase/stash/CI/conflict studio + Smart-Flow; **Cloud** = PR/CI activity scoped by provider). Auth lives in **Settings → Connected accounts**. Replaces `/git-config`, `/git-vcs`, and `/cloud-git`. **Cloud tab partial:** no API-side merge from Lumina, no notification inbox; activity panels otherwise live. |
| `/git-config` | redirect | → `/git?tab=config` |
| `/git-vcs` | redirect | → `/git?tab=vcs` |
| `/cloud-git` | redirect | → `/git?tab=cloud` |
| `/registry` | redirect | → `/git?tab=vcs` |
| `/profiles` | partial | CRUD + duplicate + export/import; **Set Active** writes `active_profile` as `baseTemplate` (`ComposeProfile`). **On launch**: optional `composeUp` for active profile (store `on_login_automation`). Deeper preset/dashboard unification still evolving. |
| `/terminal` | partial | Embedded terminal works; host/sandbox differences still affect behavior. |
| `/runtimes` | partial | Status/version/deps/uninstall preview are live; install/update/remove backend is in active hardening. |
| `/maintenance` | partial | Guardian + diagnostics + host probes. **Tasks**: user checklist on Overview + full editor on Schedule. **Git backups** on **Git Config → Backups**. No arbitrary host shell or full remediation. |
| `/settings` | partial | Dev Home layout: personalization, SSH overview, **Connected accounts** (GitHub/GitLab auth), **System** tab (`/etc/hosts` read/edit via pkexec + diff-before-apply, process env diagnostics, `~/.profile` export editor), general, update, notifications, shortcuts, help, datetime, languages, app engine, builder, beta flags. **Extension tab removed** — not in scope. |

## Update Rule

When a route behavior changes from placeholder to real backend flow (or vice versa), update this table in the same PR.
