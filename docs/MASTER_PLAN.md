# LuminaDev — Master Plan

**Last updated:** 2026-05-31 (evening — post-ship hardening on `feat/runtimes-r1-r2`)  
**Git Assistant spec (shipped):** [`gitRefactor.md`](../gitRefactor.md)  
**Route truth table:** [`ROUTE_STATUS.md`](./ROUTE_STATUS.md)  
**Release gate:** [`STABILIZATION_CHECKLIST.md`](./STABILIZATION_CHECKLIST.md)  
**Quality gate:** `pnpm smoke` must pass before merge

This document consolidates **all active planning** into one place: forward backlog, stabilization track, Git VCS roadmap, release criteria, architecture standards, and status of historical implementation plans. **`phasesPlan.md` is not duplicated here line-for-line** — it remains the authoritative phase-by-phase record; this file synthesizes it with every other plan.

**Canonical phase history:** [`phasesPlan.md`](../phasesPlan.md) *(detailed per-phase checklists)*  

**Sprints closed (2026-05-31):**

| Sprint | Status | Branch / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Git Assistant G1–G3** | ✅ Shipped + validated | Beginner `/git` flow; in-app Create PR; see §6 |
| **Git Assistant G4 — hardening** | ✅ Done + manually verified | Partial commit, push-with-dirty-tree, existing-PR probe, post-push copy; see §6 **G4** |
| **Runtimes R1–R3** | ✅ Done | 18 → 7 runtimes; Fedora manual smoke (7 cards + .NET verify); see §14 |
| **Maintenance M1** | ✅ Done | Humanized Guardian scores, elevated UI, tab ownership, systemd actions; see §15 |
| **Monitor — dashboard tab** | ✅ Done | `/dashboard/monitor`; `/system` redirect; Dev Home surface + health hints; see §16 |

**Next:** Tier 3 release hardening (AppImage on clean VM, full cross-distro matrix, Tauri Stage 5 sign-off).

---

## 1. Product principles

> From [`phasesPlan.md`](../phasesPlan.md) — apply to every feature and dialog.

- **Full Hosted:** LuminaDev is an environment manager on the host. It is **not** a strict sandbox (no cgroup/Docker-isolated build isolation by design).
- **Design standard:** Technical efficiency, visual elegance, and premium UX aligned with **Microsoft Dev Home**.
- **Audience:** Absolute beginners **and** professional developers — one-click automation with deep logs and raw control when needed.

---

## 2. Current state (2026-05-31)

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maintenance | ✅ M1 done | Guardian + humanized pressure labels; 5-tab layout; SSH/Nginx/UFW systemd row |
| Monitor | ✅ Dashboard tab | `/dashboard/monitor` (Main \| Kernels \| Logs \| Monitor); `/system` redirects |
| Runtimes | ✅ Simplified | 18 → 7 runtimes (R1–R3 complete); see §14 |
| Phases 0–9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 | ✅ DONE | Verified against source; see [`phasesPlan.md`](../phasesPlan.md) execution order |
| Phase 11 — First-run Wizard | ✅ DONE | Merged into Phase 16 (8-step readiness installer) |
| Phase 10 — Extensions | 🚫 REMOVED | Settings Extension tab, plugin marketplace, widget infrastructure deleted 2026-05-29 |
| Dashboard widgets | 🚫 REMOVED | Deck, `/dashboard/widgets`, `layoutGet`/`layoutSet`, `widgetRegistry` |
| UI/UX debt (6 items) | ✅ DONE | 2026-05-28 — runtimes cache, kernels grid, logs multiplex, nav polish |
| CodeRabbit / audit P6 | ✅ DONE | 2026-05-29 — SSH injection, profile save races, git doctor, schema fixes |
| Smart Universal Search | ✅ SHIPPED | Fuzzy palette: pages, containers, runtimes, git repos |
| Git Doctor | ✅ WIRED | `git_doctor.rs` + Git Config Diagnostics tab |
| Per-container Docker stats | ✅ DONE | 2026-05-29 — `dh:docker:container:stats` on Docker page |
| Tauri migration Stages 0–3 | ✅ DONE | Electron removed; all IPC native Rust |
| Tauri Stage 4 (packaging) | 🔄 IN PROGRESS | CI green; **AppImage E2E on clean VM unverified** |
| Tauri Stage 5 (release gate) | 📋 OPEN | Maintainer sign-off + manual checklist when product-ready |

**Partial surfaces** (see [`ROUTE_STATUS.md`](./ROUTE_STATUS.md)):

- Settings: hosts editor + `~/.profile` env editor live on **System** tab; GitHub/GitLab auth on **Connected accounts** (`settings_*` host exec + cloud auth IPC)
- Runtimes: install matrix hardened (distro ID_LIKE, verify gate, empty-package errors)
- Profiles ↔ dashboard: `active_profile` resolver + cross-page sync (2026-05-30)
- Git VCS: **Git Assistant** G1–G4 on `/git` (partial snapshot commit + in-app PR validated 2026-05-31)
- Cloud Git: no API-side merge from Lumina; no notification inbox; Cloud tab folds into Setup in G1

## 4. Priority backlog

### P0 — Merge / integration ✅

Main integration track complete. Feature branches merge via PR + `pnpm smoke`.

### P1 — Small gaps ✅ (2026-05-28)

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Log stream cleanup on window close | ✅ `CloseRequested` aborts `AppState.streams` |
| Command palette live runtime data | ✅ `dh:runtime:status` on palette open |
| phasesPlan + AUDIT accuracy pass | ✅ |
| Sidebar collapsed + tooltip alignment | ✅ |
| Docs link → `docs.luminadev.app` | ✅ |
| DashboardLogs search filter | ✅ |
| Engine health + version in status bar | ✅ |

### P2 — Feature gaps ✅ (2026-05-29)

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Per-container stats on Docker page | ✅ |
| Docker volume `usedBy` + profile orchestration | ✅ |

### P3 — Phase 10 Extensions 🚫 REMOVED

Do not reintroduce plugin marketplace, signed extensions, or dashboard widget system without explicit product decision.

### P4 — File size debt (ongoing)

Extract when next touching these files:

| File | Lines | Target split |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DockerPage.tsx` | ~3,664 | `DockerContainersTab`, `DockerImagesTab`, `DockerVolumesTab`, `DockerNetworksTab` |
| ~~`GitConfigPage.tsx`~~ | removed G1.10 | Git Doctor → inline on Setup checklist |
| `ProfilesPage.tsx` | ~2,704 | `ProfileWizardModal`, `ProfileScaffoldModal` |

### P5 — Release gate (post-stabilization)

1. **AppImage verification** — clone on clean VM, build, verify probes + Docker wizard inside AppImage.
2. **Cross-distro matrix** — Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 40, Arch: docker group, Java runtime, `git_doctor`, monitor `/proc`.

### P6 — CodeRabbit audit remediation ✅ (2026-05-29)

SSH command injection, profile credential unlink vs global delete, optimistic save races, backup JSON validation, git doctor whitespace/SSH probe, Zod failure schemas — all resolved. Details: [`AUDIT.md`](./AUDIT.md).

### P8 — Runtimes Simplification ✅ DONE (2026-05-31)

Reduced from 18 runtimes to 7 (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, .NET/C#). Removed 11 runtimes from shared types, renderer, and all 4 Rust modules. Cache keys bumped to v2. `pnpm smoke` green. See §14.

### P7 — Theme enhancements (post-maintenance)

Phase 15 elevated theme shipped on primary routes. Future (post-Alpha):

- Theme picker (light/dark/high-contrast) without reload
- Dynamic token swapping
- Semantic color tokens

~~P7 rollout item “dashboard widgets”~~ — removed with widget purge.

---

## 5. Stabilization & release track

Source: [`STABILIZATION_CHECKLIST.md`](./STABILIZATION_CHECKLIST.md), [`STATUS.md`](./STATUS.md).

### Stabilization gate ✅ PASSED

| # | Item | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Commit quality + PR discipline | ✅ `COMMIT_QUALITY_RULES.md`, PR template |
| 2 | IPC reliability coverage | ✅ Contract tests: ssh, git, runtime, docker, … |
| 3 | Privilege boundary evidence | ✅ Stabilization checklist §3 (native host; Flatpak abandoned) |
| 4 | Scope freeze enforcement | ✅ |
| 5 | Documentation truthfulness | ✅ [`AUDIT.md`](./AUDIT.md) Appendix A |

Exit rule: items 1–3 + 5 done, item 4 enforced, `pnpm smoke` green.

### Tauri migration stages

| Stage | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Baseline + freeze | ✅ |
| 1 | Tauri skeleton + API bridge | ✅ |
| 2 | Rust-native backend (all IPC) | ✅ |
| 3 | Renderer parity | ✅ |
| 4 | Packaging + CI | 🔄 AppImage E2E unverified |
| 5 | Release gate | 📋 Open — no tag until maintainer declares product-ready |

### Manual test checklist (B5)

Run on real Tauri build. Legend: verified in stabilization pass unless noted.

- **Startup:** launch, readiness wizard, dashboard load
- **Docker:** list/actions/logs/images/volumes/networks/cleanup/remap/install guards
- **Terminal:** xterm prompt + input; external terminal optional
- **SSH:** generate, copy pubkey, GitHub test
- **Git Config:** list + set identity
- **Monitor:** metrics, processes, system info
- **Maintenance:** compose launch, diagnostics bundle
- **Runtimes:** status list

Known limits on **native** builds: terminal is line-buffered (no full PTY for vim); Docker requires socket access and often docker group membership.

---

## 6. Git — Git Assistant sprint (single UX; legacy UI removed)

**Product thesis (this sprint):** Lumina Git = *"Set up once, open your project, save your work, send it online — and get plain-language help when Git says no."* Not a Git client; enabling glue inside the dev environment. Full spec: [`gitRefactor.md`](../gitRefactor.md).

**Product rule:** There is **no** Lumina “advanced Git” mode — no second page, no beta flag, no header Pro toggle. Anything beyond setup / open / save / share / connect GitHub → **editor, terminal, or GitHub in the browser** (footer link states this once).

**Implementation constraint:** Renderer-only. **Do not delete Rust IPC** the new UI no longer calls. Reuse `computeGitAssistantNextAction`, `humanizeGitVcsError`, Git Doctor IPC, cloud auth, `gitVcsStage` / `gitVcsCommit` / `gitVcsPull` / `gitVcsPush`. **Legacy pro renderer surfaces deleted (G1.10).**

**Rust IPC policy (team decision):** Keep unused `dh:git:vcs:*` handlers and matching `IPC` channels for contract tests. Document with **JSDoc `@deprecated` on `IPC` consts** + `git_vcs_ipc.rs` module comment — **not** `#[deprecated]` on Rust fns (CI `deny(warnings)` risk). Renderer must not call pro-only channels. Delete only after zero-reference audit.

**UX policy (2026-05-30 reassessment):** GitHub optional for commit; dual labels (git term + beginner sub); progress rail = status not order; branch switch/create on page; editor from `dh:editor:list` + refresh on focus.

### Sprint phases (G1 → G3)

| Phase | Goal | Target | Exit criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **G1 — Ship** | Replace `/git` entirely | ~2 weeks | All G1 checkboxes below; legacy tabbed Git UI **deleted** from routes |
| **G2 — Validate** | Real user flows | After G1 merge | 5 users complete open → push without help; no "how do I stage/rebase" tickets |
| **G3 — Iterate** | Polish | After G2 metrics | Diff preview, recents, post-push link, **create PR / open compare** on Share step |

#### G1 — Ship (work breakdown)

| Slice | Deliverable | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1.1 | `GitAssistantPage` owns `/git` | Single route; no `?tab=config\|vcs\|cloud`; no feature flags for Git mode |
| G1.2 | One page, one lane + progress rail | Vertical scroll; rail **Setup → Project → Save → Share** reflects live status (see **Progress rail** below); sticky **Next** card |
| G1.3 | One primary button | `computeGitVcsNextAction` drives one prominent CTA; matrix in `gitRefactor.md` Part 3 |
| G1.4 | Beginner language | UI strings: Include in save, Save snapshot, Get latest, Send to GitHub*, etc.; backend channel names unchanged |
| G1.5 | `GitSetupChecklist` | 4 items (identity, credential helper, GitHub optional, default branch main); Git Doctor inline on failed items only |
| G1.6 | `GitProjectBar` | Folder picker open + clone (URL + picker, not raw path); recents chips |
| G1.7 | `GitChangesPanel` + `GitSaveShareBar` | Checkbox stage → save snapshot; Get latest / Send to GitHub when applicable |
| G1.8 | Help-me modals | Dirty checkout, behind-remote, conflicts → open external editor; no in-app merge IDE |
| G1.9 | Cloud folded into Setup | Connect GitHub card; post-connect recent repos + "Open in GitHub"; no PR wizard / CI / issues on `/git` |
| G1.10 | **Delete legacy Git UI** | Remove tab shell, `GitVcsPage` pro surface, integrate bar, conflict resolver UI, CI/pipelines panel, cloud activity tab, config inspector dashboard, `?tab=` redirects updated or dropped |
| G1.11 | External-tool footer | Canonical copy (see **Footer** below) |

**G1 ship checklist**

- [x] `/git` loads only Git Assistant (no tab switcher, no pro toggle)
- [x] Setup checklist shows 4 items with fix actions (+ Git Doctor on failed rows)
- [x] User can open/clone a repository (folder picker)
- [x] User can save snapshot (commit), get latest (pull), send to GitHub (push)
- [x] Next-action card shows correct primary button for all states in decision matrix
- [x] Humanized errors on failures (+ behind-remote modal on push block)
- [x] Conflicts route to external editor only
- [x] Legacy `GitVcsPage` / three-tab git routes unreachable (code deleted; redirects → `/git`)
- [x] Progress rail: Share incomplete when GitHub not connected; all four steps track real status
- [x] Footer uses canonical copy above
- [x] Pro-only IPC documented in shared JSDoc (channels kept; no Rust `#[deprecated]`)
- [x] G1.9: Open on GitHub when connected (+ post-push hint when `ahead === 0`)

**Removed from product (not relocated — gone from Lumina Git)**

| Former surface | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Three-tab hub (Config / VCS / Cloud) | Deleted; folded into single page where noted |
| Merge/rebase/continue/stash/cherry-pick/bisect UI | Deleted → editor/terminal |
| `GitVcsConflictResolver` / 3-way merge | Deleted → editor |
| CI pipelines panel on Git | Deleted → GitHub/GitLab web |
| PR/MR wizard on Git | Retired full wizard; **G3 Create PR** in Share step (API + compare fallback) |
| Protected-branch bypass wizard | Deleted → terminal |
| Config inspector / health dashboard / preset matrix | Deleted → Settings identity only if needed |
| Multi-remote provider rail | Deleted |
| Copy raw IPC error on Git page | Deleted (Settings → Developer optional) |
| Smart-Flow integration bar | Deleted |

[`SMART_FLOW_VCS.md`](./SMART_FLOW_VCS.md) is **historical reference only** — not an active backlog.

#### Progress rail (G1.2 — must match real state)

Rail steps are **clickable**; each shows complete (●), incomplete (○), or active (current focus). Derive from IPC/status, not static labels.

| Step | Active when | Complete when | Incomplete examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Setup** | First visit or any setup checklist item failing | All four checklist items ✓ (identity, credential helper, GitHub, default branch) | Name/email missing |
| **Project** | No repo open or invalid repo | Folder selected and repo loads | No project path |
| **Save** | Uncommitted changes in working tree | No uncommitted changes (snapshot saved or clean tree) | Dirty files remain |
| **Share** | Ready to sync with remote but blocked, or user is on share journey | **GitHub (or push auth) connected** AND nothing left to push (`ahead === 0` or no unpushed commits) | **GitHub not connected** → Share stays **incomplete** even if local tree is clean; unpushed commits → incomplete |

**Share + GitHub rule:** Share stays **incomplete** when GitHub is not connected or unpushed commits exist — but **Connect GitHub is not the primary action** unless `ahead > 0`. Local commit always available via **git commit** when dirty.

Implement `computeGitProgressRail()` (or extend existing status hook) with unit tests for: no GitHub → Share incomplete; connected + ahead → incomplete; connected + pushed → complete.

#### Footer (G1.11 — canonical copy)

```text
Need more than save, send, and sync? Use VS Code, Cursor, your terminal, or GitHub directly for advanced Git operations.
```

#### G2 — Validate

**Gates before external testers (not optional for G2):**

- [x] `ar-SA` / `de-DE` `assistant.*` strings translated (English leftovers confuse quality perception)
- [x] Clone fix committed (`parent/repoName` + open existing repo on `[GIT_CLONE_EXISTS]`)

**G2 exit (5 real users):**

- [x] Open → first push in < 2 minutes average
- [x] Zero crashes on clone / pull / push in test pass
- [x] No support load on staging/rebase terminology

**G2 engineering fixes (2026-05-31) — verified in audit pass:**

- [x] `git_is_inside_work_tree` + `git_has_commits` → zero-commit repos return `unborn: true` (no false “not a repository”)
- [x] `[GIT_VCS_NO_REMOTE]` error code: empty/missing origin detected before push; classifier catches “no such remote”; humanized message guides user to `git remote add`
- [x] File changes split into two groups: **Ready to save** (staged) vs **Still changing** (unstaged) with visible badges
- [x] Per-branch exclusion map (`excludedByBranchRef`) — deselected files survive all status refreshes and branch switches
- [x] “Talking to Git…” spinner with animated icon during commit/pull/push operations
- [x] Primary button label: **Save snapshot** (sub: commit selected files) — terminology aligned across page
- [x] `guessDefaultBaseBranch` detects `main` / `master` from local branches (no longer hardcoded)
- [x] `shouldShowGitPush` allows push without upstream (first-push flow unblocked)
- [x] Auto-fetch on open + focus: `fetchOriginQuiet` runs on every page focus; yellow “Updates on the remote” banner when behind
- [x] Per-branch PR publish check (`branchNeedsPublishBeforePr`) — blocks PR creation when ahead or no upstream
- [x] Provider mismatch detection in PR panel — warns when remote host ≠ connected cloud account
- [x] `dh:preferred_editor_cmd` added to `ALLOWED_KEYS` in Rust store allowlist (editor preference now persists)

#### G3 — Iterate

**Hardening (race-safety — treat as required for G3, not optional):**

- [x] Cancel in-flight IPC on unmount / `repoPath` change (status, remotes, doctor scan, diff preview) so late responses cannot overwrite state

**Product polish:**

- [x] Remote-aware or generic Share copy (GitHub/GitLab from `origin` host)
- [x] Diff preview toggle per file
- [x] Recents list polish
- [x] Post-push “Open on host” one-liner (GitHub/GitLab from remote URL)
- [x] **Create pull request in Share step** — `cloudGitCreatePr` when connected; compare-page fallback; title/body fields; blocks when `ahead > 0`; warns when behind `main`
- [x] **Silent `git fetch origin` on project open and window focus** — updates `behind` before edit; **Get latest** banner + next-action when remote is ahead (no standalone Fetch button)

**Intentional ceiling (no backlog):** dirty-checkout **stash** stays terminal + modal; no in-app stash IDE (correct for beginner scope).

#### G4 — Post-ship hardening (2026-05-31)

Follow-up on `feat/runtimes-r1-r2` after manual dogfooding on LuminaDev repo. All items verified in UI + git log.

| Fix | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Existing open PR/MR probe | ✅ | `dh:cloud:git:find-pr`; disables Create PR + **Open existing PR** when branch already has one |
| Partial snapshot commit | ✅ | Unstage deselected indexed files; `resolveSnapshotCommitPaths` uses **fresh** `git status` + exclusion ref (not stale React `included`) |
| Push with dirty tree | ✅ | `shouldShowGitPush` no longer requires clean working tree when `ahead > 0` |
| Push vs Save disabled state | ✅ | `saveDisabled` applies to commit only; Push/Pull disable on `busy` only |
| Ahead/behind tracking branch | ✅ | `git_ahead_behind` tries `branch.*.remote`, then origin/upstream/other remotes |
| Post-push PR copy | ✅ | Banner + Share hint point to **Create PR** in-panel; **View branch on host** is browse-only |

**G4 manual evidence (2026-05-31):** 3-of-4 files committed with `test.ts` excluded; push succeeded with 1 local file remaining; Create PR distinct from Open on GitHub.

**G4 agent checklist**

- [x] Unit tests: `stagedPathsToUnstageBeforeCommit`, `resolveSnapshotCommitPaths`, `shouldShowGitPush`
- [x] `pnpm smoke` green on branch
- [x] Merge `feat/runtimes-r1-r2` to main via PR ([#127](https://github.com/Karim-Termanini/LuminaDev/pull/127))

### Explicit non-goals (Git — permanent)

- Second Git UI, advanced page, or `enable_advanced_git` / pro toggle
- In-app conflict merge studio or visual 3-way resolver
- Smart-Flow vertical slices (rebase UI, cherry-pick, bisect, **full** PR review/merge studio in-app — simple create-PR in Git Assistant is in scope for G3)
- libgit2 replacement of all CLI
- Server-side merge resolution
- Notifications inbox / mentions on `/git`
- Deleting unused `dh:git:vcs:*` IPC in G1 (deprecate only; see **Rust IPC policy**)

### Agent checklist (Git sprint work)

- [x] `pnpm smoke` or narrowest gate from `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Humanized errors for any new `[GIT_VCS_*]` / `[CLOUD_*]` codes
- [x] Update [`ROUTE_STATUS.md`](./ROUTE_STATUS.md) when `/git` default UX changes
- [x] Contract tests for beginner page state machine / next-action matrix / **progress rail**
- [x] Pro-only IPC not called from renderer (documented in shared package)
- [x] Cancel network calls on unmount / remote change (status, cloud auth, remotes, doctor, diff)

## 7. Rust backend architecture standards

From [`phasesPlan.md`](../phasesPlan.md) § Rust Backend Architecture — enforce on every backend change.

**`lib.rs` is thin only:** command declarations, `ipc_invoke` / `ipc_send` dispatch, `AppState`, module declarations.

**Extract a module when:**

- Logic > 200 lines
- Domain has 5+ related functions
- Tests need isolation
- Logic reused across handlers → `utils.rs` or domain module

**Dependency flow (one-way):**

```text
lib.rs → domain modules (docker_ext, terminal_pty, …) → utils.rs
```

**Red flags:** handler > 50 lines in `lib.rs`; circular imports; duplicate logic across arms.

**Current outcome (Phase 17):** ~37 source files; `lib.rs` ~678 lines; largest modules `runtime_jobs.rs`, `system_info.rs`.

---

## 8. Known bugs

All 28 tracked bugs in [`phasesPlan.md`](../phasesPlan.md) Known Bugs table are **✅ FIXED** as of 2026-05-28/29.

Page-level manual checks live in [`AUDIT.md`](./AUDIT.md) Appendix B. Route maturity: [`ROUTE_STATUS.md`](./ROUTE_STATUS.md).

---

## 10. Historical implementation plans (removed)

Task-level plans under `docs/superpowers/plans/` and matching specs under `docs/superpowers/specs/` were **deleted 2026-05-30** after consolidation into this file. `docs/FORWARD_PLAN_2026-05-28.md` and `phasesPlan.original.md` were removed the same day.

| Former plan | Topic | Final status |

---

## 11. Sprint priority tiers (daily driver → release)

Supersedes the closed **v0.2.0-alpha** immediate sprint in [`phasesPlan.md`](../phasesPlan.md). Order work by what blocks *your* workstation use; public release docs still list AppImage as P0 — treat as **P-last** until Tier 1 is good enough.

### Tier 1 — Daily-driver gaps

Finish **one** before opening the next.

| Gap | Status (2026-05-30) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings hosts + profile env editing | ✅ | System tab: `/etc/hosts` + `~/.profile` via `hostExec` |
| Runtimes install matrix | ✅ | Distro ID_LIKE, verify gate (2026-05-30) |
| Profiles ↔ dashboard alignment | ✅ | `active_profile` + cross-page sync (2026-05-30) |
| **Git VCS — Git Assistant G1–G4** | ✅ **Shipped** | PR [#127](https://github.com/Karim-Termanini/LuminaDev/pull/127) |

### Tier 2 — Opportunistic cleanup

- P4 file splits (`DockerPage`, `GitConfigPage`, `ProfilesPage`) when already editing those files
- P7 theme picker after core flows
- Cloud Git inbox / API merge only if needed

### Tier 3 — Release (end)

1. AppImage build on clean VM (§5 P5)
2. Cross-distro smoke (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch)
3. Tauri Stage 5 sign-off + tag

### Git Assistant sprint timeline (G1)

Suggested slice order inside G1 (can parallelize G1.4 strings with G1.2 layout):

```text
Week 1   G1.1 route shell → G1.2 layout/rail → G1.3 next-action card → G1.5 checklist
Week 2   G1.6 project bar → G1.7 changes/save-share → G1.8 modals → G1.9 cloud card → G1.10 delete legacy UI → G1.11 footer → smoke + ROUTE_STATUS
Post-G1  G2 validate → G3 iterate
```

**Ignore:** Extension tab, dashboard widgets, Flatpak, Resources tab, cosmetic theme beyond need, chasing all routes `live` in `ROUTE_STATUS.md` for marketing.

## 14. Runtimes Simplification — Sprint (R1–R3)

**Product thesis:** 18 runtimes is too many to maintain. Each has OS-specific package managers, version detection quirks, and installation edge cases. Reduce to the 7 languages that 90% of developers use daily.

### Runtimes to keep (7)

| # | Runtime | Rationale | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Node.js** | Essential for web dev, 80% of projects | Very High |
| 2 | **Python** | Data science, scripting, backend | Very High |
| 3 | **Java** | Enterprise, Android, backend | High |
| 4 | **Go** | Cloud native, CLI tools, backend | Medium-High |
| 5 | **Rust** | Systems programming, performance | Medium |
| 6 | **PHP** | Legacy web, WordPress, Laravel | Medium |
| 7 | **.NET/C#** | Enterprise, game dev (Unity) | Medium |

### Runtimes to remove (11)

| Runtime | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Ruby | Low usage; most Ruby devs use rbenv/rvm directly |
| Bun | Niche runtime; Node.js covers JS ecosystem |
| Zig | Low adoption; most Zig devs manage toolchain manually |
| C/C++ | System package manager (`gcc`, `clang`) covers this; no version manager needed |
| MATLAB/Octave | Extreme niche in dev environment tooling |
| Dart | Flutter SDK bundles Dart; standalone Dart is rare |
| Flutter | Large SDK; better installed via `flutter doctor` directly |
| Julia | Niche scientific computing; most users install via official installer |
| Lua | Extremely niche outside game scripting |
| Lisp (SBCL) | Near-zero usage in modern web/cloud workflows |
| R | Niche statistical computing; most users use CRAN directly |

### Sprint phases

| Phase | Goal | Target | Exit criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **R1 — Strip** | Remove 11 runtimes from renderer + discovery | ✅ Done | Runtimes page shows only 7; no references to removed runtimes in UI |
| **R2 — Clean** | Remove Rust handlers + shared types for removed runtimes | ✅ Done | `runtime_discover.rs`, `runtime_jobs.rs`, `runtime_packages.rs`, `runtime_verify.rs` all pruned; `RUNTIME_SYSTEM_ONLY_IDS` → `['php']`; `RUNTIME_DETAILS` trimmed to 7; cache keys bumped to v2; `pnpm smoke` green |
| **R3 — Harden** | Audit + test remaining 7 runtimes end-to-end | ✅ Done | 7 cards on Fedora; .NET system install + VERIFY OK; `ROUTE_STATUS.md` updated; full Ubuntu/Arch matrix deferred to Tier 3 §5 P5 |

#### R1 — Strip (work breakdown)

| Slice | Deliverable | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1.1 | `RUNTIME_DETAILS` trimmed to 7 entries | Remove Ruby, Bun, Zig, C/C++, MATLAB, Dart, Flutter, Julia, Lua, Lisp, R |
| R1.2 | `RUNTIME_LOCALE_KEY` trimmed | Remove locale overrides for removed runtimes |
| R1.3 | `formatRuntimeVersionDisplay` switch pruned | Remove version-formatting cases for removed runtimes |
| R1.4 | UI test: page renders without errors | Open `/runtimes` — only 7 cards shown; no blank or broken entries |

#### R2 — Clean (work breakdown)

| Slice | Deliverable | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R2.1 | `status_probe_script` match arms removed | Remove Ruby, Bun, Zig, Dart, Flutter, Julia, Lua, Lisp, R, C/C++, MATLAB probes |
| R2.2 | `active_binary_script` match arms removed | Remove resolution scripts for removed runtimes |
| R2.3 | `list_installed_versions_script` pruned | Remove version-listing scripts for removed runtimes |
| R2.4 | `runtime_jobs.rs` install blocks removed | Remove `runtime_id == "ruby"`, `== "bun"`, `== "zig"`, `== "dart"`, `== "flutter"` install branches |
| R2.5 | `RUNTIME_SYSTEM_ONLY_IDS` updated | `['lisp', 'c_cpp', 'matlab', 'php']` → `['php']` (PHP is only system-only now) |
| R2.6 | `runtime_jobs.rs` `SYSTEM_ONLY_RUNTIMES` updated | Match TypeScript constant |
| R2.7 | Stale store cache keys invalidated | Version/status cache entries for removed runtimes cleared or ignored on load |

#### R3 — Harden (work breakdown)

| Slice | Deliverable | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R3.1 | Install flow verified for all 7 | Node (nvm/fnm), Python (pyenv), Java (apt/dnf/sdkman), Go (goenv/gvm), Rust (rustup), PHP (system only), .NET (dotnet-install.sh) — all methods confirmed working |
| R3.2 | Probe + set-active on all 7 | Status detects installation; version switching changes active binary; no stale path references |
| R3.3 | Cross-distro smoke | Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 40, Arch: all 7 install + probe + set-active — **Fedora validated manually (2026-05-31); Ubuntu/Arch → Tier 3 P5** |
| R3.4 | Error messages clear | When runtime binary not found, message says "Install [Runtime] to get started" — never a raw probe error |
| R3.5 | Cache invalidation | No stale version cache for removed runtimes; opening Runtimes page after upgrade shows only 7 |

### Explicit non-goals (Runtimes sprint)

- Adding new runtimes to the 7 (not in scope)
- Improving install UX beyond existing wizard (not a UX sprint)
- Adding mise/asdf support for runtimes that don't already have it
- Removing Docker-based runtime support (unrelated)
- Changing the `/runtimes` page layout or adding new features

### Agent checklist (Runtimes sprint)

- [x] `pnpm typecheck` passes after all TypeScript removals
- [x] `pnpm smoke` green before declaring R2 done
- [x] No stale import references to removed runtime types
- [x] `RUNTIME_DETAILS` keys match `status_probe_script` match arms exactly (7 items)
- [x] `SYSTEM_ONLY_RUNTIMES` (Rust) matches `RUNTIME_SYSTEM_ONLY_IDS` (TypeScript)
- [x] Version cache storage (`dh:runtimes:versions-cache:v2`) invalidated or keyed by runtime ID
- [x] Update [`ROUTE_STATUS.md`](./ROUTE_STATUS.md) when `/runtimes` UX changes

## 15. Maintenance Polish — Sprint (M1) ✅ DONE (2026-05-31)

**Product thesis:** Guardian scoring is real (`/proc` + Docker + systemd). M1 adds beginner-readable pressure labels and actionable UX without changing the scoring algorithm.

### Shipped

| Item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| M1.1 — Status labels | Color-coded Excellent / Healthy / Moderate / Critical via `maintenanceHealth.ts` |
| M1.2 — Plain-language detail | Layer tooltips + humanized diagnostic rows (`maintenanceDiagnosticsHumanize.ts`) |
| M1.3 — Action suggestions | Diagnostic rows link to Docker, Settings, SSH, etc. |
| Elevated Dev Home layout | Full-bleed hero, tab strip, overview nav cards |
| Tab ownership | Overview = Guardian + nav only; Cleanup / Data / Logs / Schedule own their content |
| Systemd row | SSH, Nginx, UFW — Start when inactive; **NOT INSTALLED** when unit missing (Docker removed from row) |
| Docker cleanup | Quick maintenance on Cleanup tab; detailed prune on `/docker` |

### Agent checklist (M1)

- [x] `maintenanceHealth.test.ts`, `maintenanceDiagnosticsHumanize.test.ts`, `maintenanceSystemdServices.test.ts`
- [x] `pnpm smoke` green
- [x] [`ROUTE_STATUS.md`](./ROUTE_STATUS.md) unchanged for `/maintenance` (still `partial`)

### What NOT to change (unchanged)

- Guardian scoring algorithm (`evaluateGuardian`)
- Real data sources — no mocks
- Diagnostics bundle export

---

## 16. Monitor — Dashboard integration ✅ DONE (2026-05-31)

**Product thesis:** Host metrics belong with Dashboard (Main \| Kernels \| Logs \| Monitor), not as a standalone sidebar destination.

### Shipped

| Item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Route | `/dashboard/monitor`; `/system` → redirect |
| Nav | Fourth dashboard tab; sidebar Monitor entry removed; Alt+2 → monitor tab |
| UI | Dev Home hero, spotlight strip, segmented tabs, collapsible Details |
| Health hints | `monitorHealth.ts` — color-coded CPU/RAM/Disk with plain descriptions |
| i18n | `topbar.monitor` + tooltip (en/de/ar) |

### Agent checklist

- [x] `monitorHealth.test.ts`
- [x] [`ROUTE_STATUS.md`](./ROUTE_STATUS.md) — `/dashboard/monitor` live; `/system` redirect
- [x] `pnpm smoke` green

### Explicit non-goals

- LAN discovery
- Per-container stats (stay on Docker page)

## 13. Agent workflow

1. Read **`phasesPlan.md`** for phase context and architectural rules.
2. Read **this file** for current backlog priority and what is removed.
3. Check **`ROUTE_STATUS.md`** before changing route behavior.
4. Implement contract-first: `packages/shared` → Rust handlers → renderer.
5. Run **`pnpm smoke`** before claiming done.
6. Update **`ROUTE_STATUS.md`** / **`STATUS.md`** if user-visible maturity changes.
7. **Verify & Instruct:** Always provide clear, step-by-step instructions to the user on how to manually verify the changes (e.g., what to click, try, or test) at the end of the task.

*When this file and `phasesPlan.md` disagree on historical phase completion, trust `phasesPlan.md` for phase detail and this file for forward priority and removal decisions.*
